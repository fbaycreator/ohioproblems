            Drew Meester (Mr Sir) commited a federal crime. Isaiah Hamilton, the father of the victim. had freshly created an innocent creature. but, minutes into his creation Mr Sir asked to hold this creation. Isaiah, knowing Mr Sir's history declined. but Mr Sir kept on aggresively requesting to hold it. Isaiah, being to good human being he is, finally gave in. and when Mr Sir got his hands on the poor thing. he SKINNED IT ALIVE!!! A few hours later, Isaiah began asking for help in his court case, and most people agreed. so, an ongoing lawsuit was started. but minutes later, Benjamin Collier commited attempted murder multiple times on the injured man. But thats not it! Sam Harry asked Mr Sir, who is undeniably a Criminal at this point, gave Sam permission to kidnap Isaiah's injured creation. While only temporary, you cannot deny the trauma this had to have given the poor thing.
